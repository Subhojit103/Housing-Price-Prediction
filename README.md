# Housing-Price-Prediction
Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the delhi region. it wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area , bedrooms, parking etc.
Essentially the company wants-

- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g area , number of rooms, bedrooms e.t.c
- To create the linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area , number 
of bathrooms etc.
- To know the accuracy of the model , i.e how well these variables can predicts house prices
